Mercy with the morning sun,
               A            A
Hope when I am hanging by a thread,

  F#m       E             D/F#   D/F#
I find Your faithfulness again.

Water in the wilderness,

My Defender in the lion’s den,

                   A
Love that held Him to the cross,
                A                A
Til He paid the price for all my sin,
            D/F#     E         F#m
A temporary tomb was sealed by stone,
       E                 D/F#   A
But it couldn’t keep Him in.
 
 
[Verse 4]
                A
Now that He has conquered death,
                 A            A
Tell me what’s impossible for Him,
               D      E     F#m
If the Lord my God is on my side,
     E            D/F#           A
Then who can be against. Ooh ooh ooo oo oo oo ooh.
