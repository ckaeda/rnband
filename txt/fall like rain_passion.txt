[Intro]
C     G     Am     C
 
[Verse 1]
C
God, I live to worship You
G
All my life I offer You
Am                        F
Simple melodies of sacrifice
C
Open hands and open heart
G
You’re the only one I want
     Am                          F
Your presence is my treasure, my delight
 
 
[Chorus]
C           G
Fall like rain
             Am          C/E
Holy Spirit, fall like rain
             C           G
Holy Spirit, have Your way
               Am
Let Your glory fall down
               F
Let Your glory fall down
 
 
[Verse 2]
    C
One thing I ask, one thing I seek
G
So much more than anything
   Am                          C        F
To dwell within Your house for all my days
C
Knowing You is everything
   G
So I let go of lesser things
Am            G            F
You alone are worthy of my praise
Am           G                F
Stir in me a passion for Your name
 
 
[Chorus]
C           G
Fall like rain
             Am          C/E
Holy Spirit, fall like rain
             C           G
Holy Spirit, have Your way
               Am
Let Your glory fall down
               F
Let Your glory fall down

May I never lose the wonder of Your presence

May I always stand in awe of who You are
        C                    Dm7
Oh, the beauty and the gift of Your friendship
     C/E                       F
Is unlike anything I’ve ever known

Let Your glory fall down
