[Verse 1]
A
Wandering into the night
A
Wanting a place to hide
           D                 A
This weary soul, this bag of bones
A
And I tried with all my might
A
But I just can't win the fight
           D           A
I'm slowly drifting, a vagabond

[Pre-Chorus]
    E                      F#m
And just when I ran out of road
  D                  A
I met a man I didn't know
    E              F#m         D
And He told me that I was not alone

[Chorus]
A
He picked me up
Bm7
Turned me around
A/C#              D
Placed my feet on solid ground
            F#m
I thank the Master
            D
I thank the Savior
A
Because He healed my heart
Bm7
He changed my name
   A/C#           D
Forever free, I'm not the same
            F#m
I thank the Master
            D
I thank the Savior
        A
I thank God

[Verse 2]
A
I cannot dеny what I see
A
Got no choice but to believе
              D
My doubts are burning
                  A
Like ashes in the wind
A
So, so long to my old friends
A
Burden and bitterness
                     D
You can just keep it moving
                       A
Nah, you ain't welcome here

[Pre-Chorus 2]
     E                              F#m
From now till I walk the streets of gold
     D                        A
I'll sing of how you saved my soul
     E               F#m                D
This wayward son has found his way back home

[Chorus]
A
He picked me up
Bm7
Turned me around
A/C#             D
Placed my feet on solid ground
            F#m
I thank the Master
            D
I thank the Savior
A
Because He healed my heart
Bm7
He changed my name
   A/C#           D
Forever free, I'm not the same
            F#m
I thank the Master
            D
I thank the Savior
        A
I thank God
