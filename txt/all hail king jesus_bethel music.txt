[Intro]
E A
 
 
[Verse 1]
E
There was a moment when the lights went out
C#m
When death had claimed its victory
B
The King of Love had given up His life
A2
The darkest day in history
 
 
[Verse 2]
E                               B/E
 There on a cross they made for sinners
C#m                             B/C#
   For every curse His blood a-toned
B
 One final breath and it was finished
A2
  But not the end we could have known
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
      F#m       C#m    B
For the earth began to shake,
         E   E/G# A
And the veil was torn
     F#m  C#m       B            E  E/G# A
What sac-rifice was made, As the heavens roared

 All hail King Jesus

[Verse 3]
 
E
 There was a moment when the sky lit up
C#m
   A flash of light breaking through
B                                     E
 When all was lost He crossed eternity,
A
 The King of life was on the move
 
 
[Pre-Chorus 2]
         F#m  C#m  B
For in a dark cold tomb
          E   E/G# A
Where our Lord was laid
         F#m   C#m  B
One mir- acu - lous breath
               E  E/G#  A   B/A  A    A6
And we're for- ev- er   cha  -   nged
