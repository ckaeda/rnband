[Verse 1]
G                         C
  I saw Satan fall like lightning
G                         C
  I saw darkness run for cover
Em                      C
   But the miracle that I just can't get over
   Em      D              C
My name is registered in heaven
 
 
[Verse 2]
G                         C
  I believe in signs and wonders
G                      C
  I have resurrection power
Em                        C
   Still the miracle that I just can't get over
   Em      D              C
My name is registered in heaven
         Em       D               C
Yeah, my praise belongs to You forever
 
 
[Chorus]
G                 Em
  This is my testimony
      C
From death to life
G                          Em
  'Cause grace rewrote my story
     C
I'll testify
G                       Em
  By Jesus Christ, the righteous
    C
I'm justified
G                 Em
  This is my testimony
     C
This is my testimony

[Verse 3]
G                          C
  Come together, sons and daughters
G                                  C
  Bought with blood and washed in water
Em                          C
   Sing the praises of the Spirit, Son and Father
    Em       D               C
Our God will finish what He started
         Em       D               C
Yes, our God will finish what He started

  By Jesus Christ, the righteous
    C
I'm justified
G                 Em
  This is my testimony
     C
This is my testimony (Oh)

[Bridge]
G                              C
  If I'm not dead, you're not done
G                              C
  Greater things are still to come
 
Oh, I believe
G                              C
  If I'm not dead, you're not done

  Greater things are still to come
 
Oh, I believe
