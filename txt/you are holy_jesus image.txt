[Verse 1]
           C                    Am
I saw The Lord, seated on His throne.
                    F             G
He was clothed in glory, exalted high.
                      C                Am
And the train of His robe filled the temple
                  F                          G
and the angels circled round him. And they cried
G
They cried
 
 
[Chorus]
C             Am
You are holy! Oh so holy
F                     G
You are holy Lord of all!

[Verse 3]
       C               Am
Woe is me, for I am unclean.
                    F             G
For my eyes have seen, the Holy King
                     C                    Am
And He cleansed my lips, right before my eyes
                  F                    G
and the pillars shook, as the angels cried
G
And they cried

You are holy! Oh so holy

You are holy Lord of all!
