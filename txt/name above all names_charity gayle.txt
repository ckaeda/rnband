[Verse 1]
G           D                A
The sun was darkened and the heavens thundered
G     D                A
For a moment death had thought it conquered
G             D             A
But it wasn't over 'til You said, "it's over"
G            D       A
Your Word is greater still
G           D               A
The perfect sacrifice, Your body broken
G        D                 A
As You restored to us what sin had stolen
G            D                A
Once and for all You tore the veil wide open
G             D        A
Your power is stronger still
 
[Chorus]
    D           G
All praise, all praise
       Bm             A
To the name above all names
   D       G
Jesus, You reign
                  Bm             A
'Cause You're the name above all names

[Verse 2]
G              D            A
You turned the grave into a new beginning
G          D              A
Our God is risen, You're alive and breathing
G               D              A
There's nothing that can rise against Your victory
G            D      A
Your name is higher still
G            D      A
Your name is higher still

[Bridge]
                D                       G
The cross still stands, the blood still flows
            D                       A
The work is finished and hell still knows
                        Bm                        G
That the grave is still empty, the stone is still rolled
                 D
And You're still high and lifted up
             A
You're still seated on the throne
                D                       G
The cross still stands, the blood still flows
            D                       A
The work is finished and hell still knows
                        Bm                        G
That the grave is still empty, the stone is still rolled
                 D
And You're still high and lifted up
             A
You're still seated on the throne
 
[Chorus]
    D       A   G
All praise, all praise
       Bm             A
To the name above all names
   D/F#    G
Jesus, You reign
                  Bm             A
'Cause You're the name above all names
