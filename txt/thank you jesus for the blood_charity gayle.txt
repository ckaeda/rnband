[Intro]
Bb F Gm
 
[Verse 1]
Bb
I was a wretch
  Gm7
I remember who I was
      Eb         Bb
I was lost I was blind
      F
I was running out of time
Bb
Sin separated
    Gm7
The breach was far too wide
             Eb              Bb
But from the far side of the chasm
    F
You held me in Your sight
 
[Verse 2]
   Bb
So You made a way
 Gm7
Across the great divide
     Eb              Bb
Left behind Heaven's throne
   F
To build it here inside
    Bb
And there at the cross
    Gm7
You paid the debt I owed
         Eb
Broke my chains
         Bb
Freed my soul
        F
For the first time I had hope
 
[Chorus]
Bb
Thank You Jesus
        Eb       Bb
For the blood applied
Gm    F   Bb
Thank You Jesus
       Gm        F
It has washed me white
Gm    F    Eb
Thank You Jesus
               F  Gm
You have saved my life
Eb                   Bb
Brought me from the darkness
     F        Bb
Into glorious light
 
[Verse 3]
Bb                 F
You took my place
     Gm7
Laid inside my tomb of sin
         Eb               Bb
You were buried for three days
             F
But then You walked right out again
        Bb
And now death has no sting
     Gm7
And life has no end
    Eb               Bb
For I have been transformed
       F
By the blood of the Lamb
 
[Chorus]
Bb    F   Bb
Thank You Jesus
        Eb       Bb
For the blood applied
Gm    F   Bb
Thank You Jesus
       Gm        F
It has washed me white
Gm    F    Eb
Thank You Jesus
         Eb    F  Gm
You have saved my life
Eb                   Bb
Brought me from the darkness
     F         Bb
Into glorious light

Through the blood the blood
