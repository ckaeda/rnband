[Verse 1]
            G
Let faith arise
                                 C
in spite of what I see, Lord I believe, 
                                   Em
But help my unbelief, I choose to trust You
                                  C
No matter what I feel, let faith arise
 
 
[Verse 2]
            G
Let faith arise
                                   C
For my champion's not dead, He is alive! 
                                   Em
Oh, and He already knows my every need 
                               C
Surely He will come and rescue me

[Verse 3]
           G
Let faith arise,
                                    C
and see the kingdom come, I lift my eyes, oh
                                        Em
for the battle has been won, My God is faithful, oh 
                                  C
and every single word He said is true, oh
