[Verse 1]
Bm             G           D
You call me strong and courageous
Bm             G           D
When I don’t feel like I am
Bm               G        D
You could have turned me away
          A         G
But you chose me instead
 
[Verse 2]
Bm             G             D
You say that I’m going to make it
Bm             G             D
When I don’t feel like I can
Bm            G          D
You see the battle I’m facing
      A              G
And you’re stepping in
 
[Chorus]
G                    
You’re in it with me

[Verse 3]
Bm             G     D
And I have a new revelation
Bm              G             D
A saviour who calls me His friend
Bm          G          D
I used to fight on my own
      A      G
But never again
 
 
[Verse 4]
 Bm               G            D
Cause I have a power that’s greater
  Bm               G       D
Than all of the enemy’s lies
Bm           G            D
I know the truth of the gospel
       A           G
That you’re on my side
G
You’re on my side
 
 
[Chorus]

You’re in it with me
D
