[Verse 1]
          A             D
O Lord my God when I in awesome wonder,
         A       E                 A
Consider all the works Thy Hand has made,
          A                 D
I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder,
                   A       E                A
Thy power through- out the uni- verse dis- played.
 
 
[Chorus]
              A        D              A
Then sings my soul, my Saviour God to Thee,
               E                   A
How great Thou art, how great Thou art.
              A        D              A
Then sings my soul, my Saviour God to Thee,
               E        D     E    A
How great Thou art, how great Thou art.
 
 
[Verse 2]
                 A                D
When through the woods and forest glades I wander,
             A          E             A
And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees.
            A                D
When I look down, from lofty mountain grandeur
            A          E              A
And see the brook, and feel the gentle breeze.
 
 
[Chorus]
              A        D               A
Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
               E                   A
How great Thou art, how great Thou art.
              A        D              A
Then sings my soul, my Saviour God to Thee,
               E        D     E    A
How great Thou art, how great Thou art!
 
 
[Verse 3]
           A                    D
And when I think, that God, His Son not sparing;
            A      E                 A
Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in;
            A                D
That on the Cross, my burden gladly bearing,
            A       E           A
He bled and died to take away my sin.
 
 
[Chorus]
              A        D               A
Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
               E                   A
How great Thou art, How great Thou art.
              A        D               A
Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
               E        D     E    A
How great Thou art, How great Thou art!
 
 
[Verse 4]
                  A                   D
When Christ shall come, with shout of acclamation,
            A          E                A
And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart.
             A              D
Then I shall bow, in humble adoration,
            A          E                  A
And then proclaim: "My God, how great Thou art!"
 
 
[Chorus]
              A        D               A
Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
               E                   A
How great Thou art, How great Thou art.
              A        D               A
Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
               E        D     E    A
How great Thou art, How great Thou art!
