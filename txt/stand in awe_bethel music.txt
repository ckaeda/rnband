[Verse 1]
      C                  Em
I remember when I met You
   G/B                         D
The first time that I felt You
     C                        Em
When it all was just so simple
                      G      G/B
I’d just stand in awe of You
 
 
[Verse 2]
          C                Em
I don’t wanna grow familiar
        G/B                      D
Let my heart stay soft and tender
          C
When You walk into the room
     Em                     G       Em D
My response is to stand in awe of You
 
 
[Chorus]
                      C
Oh I stand in awe of You
 
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
                   D
I stand in awe of You
 
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
                   F/A
I stand in awe of You
 
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
                   D
I stand in awe of You
 
 
[Verse 3]
          C                     Em
Just to adore You is our purpose
                   G/B                 D
To make Your name higher is our focus
              C
Where we’ve made it complicated
Em                      G       Em D
Realign us to stand in awe of You
 
 
[Chorus]
                      C
Oh I stand in awe of You
 
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
                   D
I stand in awe of You
 
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
                   F/A
I stand in awe of You
 
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
                   D
I stand in awe of You
