I remember when I met You

Let my heart stay soft and tender
          C
When You walk into the room

          C                     Em
Just to adore You is our purpose

To make Your name higher is our focus
              C
Where we’ve made it complicated
Em                      G       Em D
Realign us to stand in awe of You
