   Savior I come, quiet my soul
   D  A/C# Bm 
Remember     
              A
Redemption's hill

where Your blood was spilled
        D   A/C#
for my ransom
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
Em               A
   Everything I once held dear

I count it all as lost
 
 
[Chorus]

Lead me to the cross
           D            A
where Your love poured out
                Gmaj7
Bring me to my knees
        D       A
Lord, I lay me down
             Gmaj7
Rid me of myself
    D        A
I belong to You
          Em7
Oh, lead me

Lead me to the cross

   You were as I, tempted and tried
D  A/C# Bm                  A
Human      The word became flesh
                 Gmaj7
Bore my sin and death
           D  A/C#
Now You're risen
