[Verse 1]
G                               D
Who thought I’d find You in the lowest place
Em                               D
Who thought You’d feel me in the crowd
C                           D
Who knew You’d make good of my mistakes
       C              G                        D
You’re nothing like I thought You were, You’re better
 
[Chorus]
                   C     D
What a God, what a God
                   Em    G
What a God, what a God
                   C             D
What a God, what a God
                   Em    D
What a God, what a God
 
[Verse 2]
Em                             D
I thought You’d show up for perfection
Em                             D
What kind of God looks for the lost
C                        D
They say it’s over for a sinner
    Am            Em            D
You said, no it’s not, no it’s not
    Am           Em            D
You say, no it’s not, no it’s not
 
[Chorus]
                   C     D
What a God, what a God
                   Em    D
What a God, what a God
                   C     D
What a God, what a God
                   Em    D
What a God, what a God

If the highest place I’ve reached is at Your feet
Then I’ve done it all
       Em                                D
If the best thing that I’ve seen is Your glory
Then I’ve seen it all

Your love has changed my life, forever satisfied

   C                              D
If one word is the only thing You speak
Then I’ve heard it all
     G                                  D
If I feel Your heart and never see Your hand
I still have it all
Am                       D
No treasure of this life could ever satisfy
Em              D
God, You are my everything
Em              D
God, You are my everything
Em              D

What a God, what a God
                   Em    D
What a God, what a God
                   C     D
What a God, what a God
                   Em    D
What a God, what a God
