[Verse 1]
G                  Gmaj7
Moses stood on a mountain
C                        D
Waiting for You to pass by
G                       Gmaj7
You put Your hand over his face
C                        D
So in Your Presence, he wouldn't die
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
C                  D
And all of Israel saw the glory
Em                 D             C
And it shines down through the age
Am
Now You've called me
D                       G
To boldly seek Your Face
 
 
[Chorus]
           C               D
Show me Your face, Lord
              G/B           Em
Show me Your face
         Am
And then gird up my legs
               D                     G
That I might stand in this holy place
             C           D
Show me Your face, Lord
                    Em    D    C
Your power and Your grace
         Am
I would make it to the end
D
If I can just see Your face
 
 
[Instrumental]
C    G/B    Am   D
 
 
[Verse 2]
G                  Gmaj7
David knew there was something more
C                        D
Than the ark of Your presence
G                       Gmaj7
In a manger Messiah was born
 C                        D
Among kings and peasants
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
C                  D
And all of Israel saw the glory
Em                 D             C    G/B
And it shines down through the age
Am
Now You've called me
D                       G
To boldly seek Your Face
 
 
[Chorus]
           C               D
Show me Your face, Lord
              G/B           Em
Show me Your face
         Am
And then gird up my legs
               D                     G   Am   G/B
That I might stand in this holy place
             C           D
Show me Your face, Lord
                    Em    D    C     G/B
Your power and Your grace
         Am
I would make it to the end
D
If I can just see Your face
