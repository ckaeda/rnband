Dsus2                        Dsus2/F#
  I'll worship at your throne, whisper my own love song
Dsus2/G                       Bm           A
  With all my heart I'll sing,  for You my Dad and King
Dsus2                     Dsus2/F#
  I'll live for all my days, to put a smile on Your face
Dsus2/G                   Bm                 A
  And when we finally meet, it will be for eternity
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
    Em      Bm            A
And oh, how wide You open up Your arms
                  Em          Bm             A
When I need Your love and how far You would come
               C         G                A
If ever I was lost, You say that all You feel for me
            C                                    Em     Dsus2/F#  G
Is undying love, that You showed me through the cross
